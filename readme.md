# üêû Buggy: A Simple Issue Tracker Extension

Welcome to Buggy! This project is a simple, browser-based issue tracker built as a Chrome extension. It allows a team to report issues and for an admin to view, manage, and resolve them. This README will guide you through the project's structure, how to install and use the extension, and what's next for its development.

## üöÄ How to Use the Extension

The extension has two main user types: **Workers** and **Admins**.

### For Workers (Reporting Issues)
1.  Click the **"Report an Issue"** button on the first screen.
2.  Fill out the form with the issue's title, a detailed description, and a priority level (low, medium, or high).
3.  Click **"Add Issue"** to submit your report. You'll see a success message afterward.

### For Admins (Managing Issues)
1.  Click the **"Admin Login"** button on the first screen.
2.  Log in with the default credentials:
    * **Username:** `admin`
    * **Password:** `password`
3.  After logging in, you'll see a list of all reported issues.
4.  You can click the **"Resolve"** button to change an issue's status to "resolved" or back to "open."
5.  You can click the **"Delete"** button to permanently remove an issue from the list.
6.  Use the **"Filter by Status"** dropdown to view only "open" or "resolved" issues.
7.  Click the **"Logout"** button to exit the admin view.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Install the Extension

This extension is not on the Chrome Web Store, so you'll need to install it in **developer mode**. It's a simple process:

1.  **Download the Code:** Get a copy of the project files from this GitHub repository.
2.  **Open Chrome Extensions:** In your Google Chrome browser, go to `chrome://extensions`. You can also find this by clicking the three-dot menu, navigating to **"More Tools,"** and then **"Extensions."**
3.  **Enable Developer Mode:** In the top-right corner of the extensions page, flip the **"Developer mode"** switch on.
4.  **Load the Extension:** Click the **"Load unpacked"** button that appears.
5.  **Select the Folder:** A file dialog will pop up. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the Buggy project and select it.

That's it! The Buggy extension icon should now appear in your browser's toolbar. You can pin it for easy access.

## üíª Project Structure

The project is made up of four main files that work together to create the extension:

* `index.html`: This is the main page of the extension. It contains the structure and all the visible elements, like buttons, forms, and the issue list.
* `style.css`: This file controls the look and feel of the extension. It makes the app visually appealing with colors, fonts, and layout.
* `script.js`: This is the brain of the application. It handles all the user interactions, like button clicks and form submissions. It also manages the logic for storing and displaying issues.
* `manifest.json`: This is a required file for all Chrome extensions. It provides essential information to the browser, such as the extension's name, version, and the permissions it needs (in this case, `storage` to save data).

## üìà Improvements and Future Plans

Currently, Buggy uses your browser's **local storage** to save issue data. This is great for a small, single-user setup, but it has limitations:

* **No central database:** Issues aren't shared between different computers or browsers.
* **Security risks:** The data is not encrypted.

To address this, I've been working on integrating a cloud-based database like **Firebase** to store issues more securely and make the data accessible to multiple users. This would be crucial for a real-world, scalable application.

However, I encountered **Content Security Policy (CSP)** issues, which prevent extensions from loading scripts from external sources like Firebase by default. Resolving these security policies is a key step for future development.

Future plans include:
* Implementing a Firebase database for scalable and secure issue storage.
* Improving the user interface (UI) to be more intuitive.
* Adding features like assigning issues to specific admins, adding comments, and more detailed filtering options.
